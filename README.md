# Corne Keyboard â€“ Custom Key Mapping (6-Column Version)

This repository contains my custom key remappings for the Corne (CRKBD) 6-column split keyboard.
I use the [Keymap Editor](https://nickcoutsos.github.io/keymap-editor/) for easy layout customization.
The keyboard was purchased from [Typeractive](https://typeractive.xyz/pages/build/corne_choc).
